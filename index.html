          Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture and includes
          cuisines originating from the diverse regions of China as well as from
          Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world. Because
          of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese
          cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications
          made to cater to local palates.

          The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese
          provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic
          groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and
          deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients,
          considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the
          south to subarctic in the northeast.

        Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country
        known as Italy did not unite until the 19th century, the cuisine can
        claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC.

        The country was then split for a long time and influenced by surrounding
        countries such as Spain, France and Central Europe. This and the trade
        or the location on the Silk Road with its routes to Asia influenced the
        local development of special dishes. Due to the climatic conditions and
        the different proximity to the sea, different basic foods and spices
        were available from region to region.
